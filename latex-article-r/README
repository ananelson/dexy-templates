To start a new project, copy the template/ directory to where you would like to
work. (Make sure the hidden .dexy file gets copied too!) Run dexy --setup from
inside your new project home to get started, make sure it generates a PDF file
in the output/ directory, then start modifying the LaTeX source and the R
script. You can add extra scripts and make new documents, this is just a
starting point.
